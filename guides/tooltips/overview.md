# To Tooltip Or Not To Tooltip?

Tooltips are a very important component of your form. They can significantly impact the user's ability to use a form as they provide explanations of what is required by a field, as well as guidance on what to do if the required information is not available to the user.

**Nevertheless it is not a good idea to litter a form with tooltips.**

When you are considering adding a tooltip ask yourself if your user really needs one. In accordance with GDS guidelines a tooltip should provide information that only some users may require. To clarify, if you are considering adding information that every user will need then it should appear permanently on the form as 'description' text. On the other hand, if the information you are considering adding is so obvious that only a very few, or perhaps none, of the users will need it then do not add it.

You need to make a judgement about whether a significant number of users will need a field to be explained in greater detail. You can ask a user researcher for advice if you are unsure, and it is a good idea to ask your user researcher to pay particular attention to tooltips when your form is tested with users.
