# Introduction

The Reference Data Service is an interface that allows you to connect the forms you create to the relevant data sets. It allows you to see who is the owner of that data set, what the data set includes, and gives you the ability to edit, delete, or add new data to the data set.

You can go [here](https://www.dev.refdata.homeoffice.gov.uk/) in order to review the data that is available.

Once you have found the data set you need, you can click on it to see the actual data for an entity.

It is possible to select a specific row in a dataset and see the history of that entity. This is useful to see what changes have been made and by whom, especially if you have a query about an aspect of the dataset.

You are able to request changes to the dataset, and also mark a request for a data row to be deleted. Any update will go through an approval process and the 'data owner' will review the request.

If there is an outstanding change request for a row, you can not request any further changes until that is no longer pending.

The Reference Data Service also provides the datasets that you will use when building your forms.
